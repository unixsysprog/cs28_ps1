README for tlast

  Student: William Gottschalk
  Date: 2/10/2018

Summary:

  This submission contains the files:

    tlast.c     -- entry point, reads form a utmp file and prints users 
    utmplib.c   -- manages buffering of the utmp file
    Makefile    -- the makefile
    Plan        -- a description of the design and operation of my code
    typescript  -- a sample run

Notes:
  This was definitely not my best effort. I under estimated what I would need
  to do to create an efficient work flow with c programs. Corrections have
  been made and you'll see a much better effort come homework 2.
